            Goku, the main protagonist of <em>Dragonball Z</em>, is a Saiyan
            warrior sent on a mission as a baby to take over planet Earth. As a
            child, Goku loses his memory and grows up with a gentle, kind heart
            under the care of his grandfather, Gohan. Goku learns martial arts
            and becomes one of the best fighters in the world, always looking
            for other opponents to help him test his limits. Throughout
            <em>Dragonball Z</em>, Goku gets into dangerous encounters with
            powerful enemies to protect his loved ones and planet Earth. Known
            for his strong determination, boundless optimism, and love for
            battle, Goku often pushes himself beyond his limits, achieving
            legendary transformations. His strength, heart, and loyalty make him
            a beloved hero.

            Vegeta, the Prince of all Saiyans, is one of the main characters in
            <em>Dragonball Z</em>. Known for his pride and fierce rivalry with
            Goku, Vegata has a relentless drive to be the strongest just like
            Goku. Despite starting as a villain in the series, his character
            delopment significally improves over time, forming alliances and
            even friendships with the Z Fighters to protect planet Earth from

          <h2 class="Gohan">Gohan</h2>
          <p class="Gohan">
            Gohan, the eldest son of Goku and Chi-Chi in <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>,
            is a character who starts off as a shy, gentle kid with immense
            untapped power. Initially uninterested in fighting, he trains under
            Piccolo after the death of Goku during the Saiyan Saga, developing
            both his combat skills and mental resilience. Gohan’s character arc
            focuses on his struggle between his desire for a peaceful life and
            his duty to protect others. His greatest moments include his
            transformation into Super Saiyan 2 during the Cell Games, where he
            ultimately defeats Cell and becomes Earth’s strongest warrior for a
            time. As he grows older, Gohan steps back from fighting to pursue
            academics, though he remains willing to step up when Earth is in
            danger. His internal conflict between his peaceful nature and his
            powerful Saiyan heritage makes him one of the series’ most complex
            and beloved characters.

            Piccolo, originally introduced as a formidable adversary in
            <em>Dragon Ball</em>, undergoes significant development throughout
            Dragon Ball Z. As the reincarnation of King Piccolo, he initially
            wanted to conquer Earth and defeat Goku. However, after training
            Goku’s son, Gohan, Piccolo’s character transforms, showcasing his
            capacity for compassion and selflessness. He becomes a crucial ally
            to the Z Fighters, often acting as a mentor and protector,
            especially to Gohan. Piccolo’s journey from villain to hero
            highlights themes of redemption and personal growth, making him a
            beloved and complex character in the series.
